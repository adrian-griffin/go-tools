# go-tools

A collection of Go tools that I have created for my own functionality. All can be used with, at most, a mediocre amount of Go experience and adjustment.

### procli
procli is a Debian-based CLI provisioning tool that auto-installs some of the most basic and needed linux packages and OhMyZsh customizations/plugins, as well as all of the `/adrian-griffin/go-tools/` Go tools. 

### ipx 
ipx is a quick CLI IP & network information collection tool. It quickly collects primary interface addresses, public/NAT addresses, DNS servers, and quickly checks for DNS leaks.

### qlip
Named partially after the astral-human border region in the world of Berserk, qliphoth, qlip is a CLI clipboard tool that stores whatever text you would like in a local text file, allowing you to list, add, or remove items from its array via a quick command. This can be useful for commands that are commonly needing to be ran that are easier pasted than typed.
